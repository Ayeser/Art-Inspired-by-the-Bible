				<p>There is no source material that has inspired more art than the Bible. Begin exploring above by doing a search for a Bible chapter or a popular artist.</p>
				<p>There is great value in considering how the Bible has inspired artists. Consider this quote from Barbara Brown Taylor in her book God in Pain: "Did [Jesus] wake up every morning wondering what God had in store for him that day and praying that he would be equal to the task? I suppose that the only people who have struggled with this question as hard as theologians have are the artists who dare to portray Christ — especially Christ on the cross — and who must decide what to show there. Should the eyes show confidence or bewilderment? Should they look up to heaven or be cast down to earth? Should the head be held high and defiant or should it fall to one side, heavy with the weight of the world? Should the hands be clenched or open? Should the body be that of someone in his prime or the husk of a man about to cast off his fetters and fly? Over the centuries, those who have portrayed Christ in paint, metal, wood, or stone have answered those questions in every conceivable way."</p>
